<p>Another major update, with the following new features and data:</p>
<ul>
<li>New and improved mutation details, with sorting and filtering capabilities.</li>
<li>In collaboration with Bilkent University, we have added a new <em>network</em> tab to our results pages.  The network tab enables users to visualize, analyze and filter cancer genomic data in the context of pathways and interaction networks derived from <a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org">Pathway Commons</a>.</li>
<li>Survival data is now available for many tumor types</li>
<li>RPPA data is now available for over 2000 samples in six tumor types</li>
<li>Based on the October Firehose run</li>
<li>Many new and updated MAF files</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="october-18-2011">October 18, 2011</h1>
<p>This release adds the following new data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the September Firehose run with new tumor types (Bladder, Liver, Low grade glioma)</li>
<li>Latest MAF files from the COADREAD and LUSC analysis working groups</li>
<li>Mutation Assessor links for all missense mutations</li>
<li>RPPA data for kidney clear cell and endometrial cancer</li>
<li>GBM case lists for transcriptional subtypes and CIMP</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="september-12-2011">September 12, 2011</h1>
<p>This is a major update, which includes the following main changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New tumor types and data: Now ~3500 samples from 12 tumor types, including mutation data for 8 tumor types.</li>
<li>RPPA data support - the Portal currently has data for ovarian and breast cancer.</li>
<li>Access control via <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>.</li>
<li>The code for the cBio Portal has now been fully open sourced, and made available at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cbio-cancer-genomics-portal/">Google Code</a>.  If you would like to join our open source efforts and make the portal even better, drop us an email.</li>
