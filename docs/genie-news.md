## July 16, 2018
 *   **Public Release 4.0 of AACR Project GENIE:**
     *   The first set of cancer genomic data aggregated through AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) was released to the global community in January 2017. The forth data set, GENIE 4.0-public, was released in July 2018 adding more than 7,800 records to the database. The combined data set now includes more than 47,000 de-identified genomic records collected from patients who were treated at each of the consortium's participating institutions, making it among the largest fully public cancer genomic data sets released to date.  These data will be released to the public every six months. The public release of the fifth data set, GENIE 5.0-public, will take place in January, 2019.
     *   The combined data set now includes data for over 80 major cancer types, including data from greater than 7,500 patients with lung cancer, nearly 5,500 patients with breast cancer, and more than 5,100 patients with colorectal cancer.
 *   More detailed information can be found in the [AACR GENIE Data Guide](http://www.aacr.org/Research/Research/Documents/GENIE%20Data%20Guide.pdf).  In addition to accessing the data via the cBioPortal, users can download the data directly from [Sage Bionetworks](http://synapse.org/genie). Users will need to create an account for either site and agree to the [terms of access](http://www.aacr.org/Documents/Terms%20of%20Access.pdf).

 *   **Public Release 2.0 of AACR Project GENIE:**
     *   The first set of cancer genomic data aggregated through AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) was released to the global community in January 2017. The second dataset was released in November 2017, adding more than 13,000 records to the database.  The combined data set now includes over 32,000 de-identified genomic records collected from patients who were treated at each of the consortiumâ€™s participating institutions, making it among the largest fully public cancer genomic data sets released to date. These data will be continuously updated on a quarterly basis.
     *   The combined data set now includes data for 59 major cancer types, including data on nearly 5,000 patients with lung cancer, nearly 4,000 patients with breast cancer, and more than 3,500 patients with colorectal cancer. For more details about the data, and how to use it, consult the [data guide](http://www.aacr.org/Research/Research/Documents/GENIE%20Data%20Guide.pdf).
