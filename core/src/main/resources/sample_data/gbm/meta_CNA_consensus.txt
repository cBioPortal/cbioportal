profile_name: Putative copy-number alterations (GBM Pathways)
profile_description: Putative copy-number calls for all genes in the hand-curated pathway of genes implicated in glioblastoma (206 cases). These calls were used for the pathway analysis in the initial TCGA manuscript, and they are the consensus of a combination of different platforms (Agilent, Affymetrix SNP6, Illumina) and methods (RAE, GISTIC, GTS).  Values: -2 = homozygous deletion; -1 = hemizygous deletion; 0 = neutral / no change; 1 = gain; 2 = high level amplification.
genetic_alteration_type: COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION
target_line: consensus
