                    The <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/home">Integrative Genomics
                    Viewer (IGV)</a> is a high-performance visualization tool for interactive exploration
                    of large, integrated datasets. It supports a wide variety of data types including sequence alignments,
                    gene expression, copy number amplifications and deletions, mutations, and genomic annotations
                </p>

                <p>Clicking the launch button below will:</p>

                    <li>load copy number data (segmented) for your selected cancer study; and</li>
                    <li>automatically highlight your query genes.</li>

                <p>
                    Once you click the launch button, you may need to select Open with Java&#8482;
                    Web Start and click OK. If the system displays messages about trusting the application,
                    confirm that you trust the application. Web Start will then download and start IGV.
                    This process can take a few minutes.
