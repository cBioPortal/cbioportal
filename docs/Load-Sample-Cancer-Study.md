# Loading a Sample Study

Once you have initialized MySQL with the seed database, you are ready to import a sample cancer study. This is recommended to verify that everything is working correctly.

The cBioPortal distribution includes a [small dummy study, `study_es_0`](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/tree/master/core/src/test/scripts/test_data/study_es_0), which contains all datatypes supported by cBioPortal. This document describes how to import the prerequisites for the sample study and how to import the study itself.

#### Import Gene Panels and Gene Sets for Sample Study

Gene panels and gene sets have to be imported before respectively gene panel study data and gene set scoring data can be added to the database.

```
cd <your_cbioportal_dir>/core/src/main/scripts
./importGenePanel.pl --data ../../test/scripts/test_data/study_es_0/gene_panel_example.txt
./importGenesetData.pl --data ../../test/resources/genesets/study_es_0_genesets.gmt --new-version 1 --supp ../../test/resources/genesets/study_es_0_supp-genesets.txt
```

More details to load your own gene panel and gene set data can be found here: [Import Gene Panels](Import-Gene-Panels.md) and [Import Gene Sets](Import-Gene-Sets.md)

#### Validating the Sample Study

First it's useful to validate the study `study_es_0`, to check if the data is formatted correctly.

To do so, go to the importer folder: 

```
cd <your_cbioportal_dir>/core/src/main/scripts/importer
```

and then run the following command:

```
./validateData.py -s ../../../test/scripts/test_data/study_es_0/ -n
```

If all goes well, you should see the final output message:

```
Validation of study succeeded with warnings.
```

#### Importing the Sample Study

To import the sample study:

```
cd <your_cbioportal_dir>/core/src/main/scripts/importer
```

and then run the following command:

```
./metaImport.py -s ../../../test/scripts/test_data/study_es_0/ -n -o
```

You will see a series of output messages, hopefulling ending with a status message like this:

```
Done.
Total time:  7742 ms
```
