# Deployment

Private instances of cBioPortal are maintained by institutions and companies [around the world](https://www.cbioportal.org/installations).

An instance can be deployed using Docker **(recommended)** or by building and deploying from source. The source code of cBioPortal is [available](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal) on GitHub under the terms of [Affero GPL V3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

To deploy cBioPortal instance on a Kubernetes cluster, we also provide [official Helm charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?org=cbioportal). You can follow the installation guide [here]().

This section contains instructions for all of the above paths.

Please note that installing a local version requires system administration skills; for example, installing and configuring Tomcat and MySQL. With limited resources, we cannot provide technical support on system administration.
