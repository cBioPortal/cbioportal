Today, we are releasing several new features to our cBio Pathway Portal:
http://cbio.mskcc.org/cancergenomics-dataportal/

New features include:

* Enhanced Oncoprints, enabling users to quickly visualize genomic alterations across many cases. Oncoprints now also work in all major browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer.
* Official release of our Web Interface, enabling programmatic access to all data.
* Official release of our R Package, enabling programmatic access to all data from the R platform for statistical computing.

The portal now includes data from:

* TCGA GBM
* The MSKCC Prostate Cancer Genome Project; and
* The MSKCC Sarcoma Project.

We are planning several new features in the upcoming months, and we would certainly appreciate your feedback and suggestions.
