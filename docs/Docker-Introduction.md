## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux. Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable filesystem such as aufs and others to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.

## Why a Docker Automated Build?

#### Automated Builds have several advantages:

- Images built in this way are built exactly as specified.
- The Dockerfile is available to anyone with access to the Docker Hub repository.
- The repository is kept up-to-date with code changes automatically.
