<br/>![Study view](images/previews/study_view.png)

# April 5, 2014
* New features:
    * Visualizing and comparing multiple tumor samples in the patient-centric view
    * Visualizing clinical events (diagnostics, lab tests, treatment, etc.) in the patient-centric view
<br/>![3D viewer & Co-expression](images/previews/multitumor-and-timeline.png)

# March 27, 2014
* New features:
    * Visualizing of mutations mapped on 3D structures (individual or multiple mutations, directly in the browser)
    * Gene expression correlation analysis (find all genes with expression correlation to your query genes)
    * The Patient-Centric View now displays mutation frequencies across all cohorts in cBioPortal for each mutation
    * The Mutation Details Tab and the Patient-Centric View now display the copy-number status of each mutation
