<br/>![Study view](images/previews/study_view.png)

# April 5, 2014
* New features:
    * Visualizing and comparing multiple tumor samples in the patient-centric view
    * Visualizing clinical events (diagnostics, lab tests, treatment, etc.) in the patient-centric view
<br/>![3D viewer & Co-expression](images/previews/multitumor-and-timeline.png)

# March 27, 2014
* New features:
    * Visualizing of mutations mapped on 3D structures (individual or multiple mutations, directly in the browser)
    * Gene expression correlation analysis (find all genes with expression correlation to your query genes)
    * The Patient-Centric View now displays mutation frequencies across all cohorts in cBioPortal for each mutation
    * The Mutation Details Tab and the Patient-Centric View now display the copy-number status of each mutation

# October 18, 2013
 
* Improved interface for survival plots, including information on individual samples via mouse-over
* New fusion glyph in OncoPrints
* Improved cross-cancer query: new alteration frequency histogram (example below - query gene: CDKN2A) and mutation diagram

# September 5, 2013:

* Linked to BAM files for single mutations via IGV.
* Updated COSMIC data (v66 Release)
* Improved / interactive visualization on the "Protein changes" tab
* Enhanced mutation diagrams: color-coding by mutation time and syncing with table filters
* Addition of DNA cytoband information in the patient view of copy-number changes
* OncoPrints now allow the display of an optional track with clinical annotation (Endometrial cancer example below)
