/**
 * A high-level script runner than can be used to run a batch of scripts within a 
 * transactional context. It's handy loading a batch of data of different types.
 * This is already deprecated, because in the long run everything should be 
 * Runnable and/or work using Spring Batch or similar, but this is a quick and 
 * easy way to get a transactional block of data loaded through different 
 * import scripts defined elsewhere. 
 * 
 * The principle is a simple one: we get a set of lines on an input stream and
 * we read from it. The lines are parsed into a class and an array of String
 * arguments, which are then passed to the corresponding class as a call to
 * their static main method. All this happens within a single JVM context, 
 * which will enclose a dependency-injected Spring context file. So we actually 
 * configure the whole caboodle (nastily) from Spring itself. 
 * 
 * Typically we'd expect two context files to be used: one for the database
 * (which will be constant for most applications) and a second which which will 
 * be generated for a study load. So a Python wrapper can generate the second
 * file, and pass it with a DB file configured for the whole portal to load
 * a study transactionally. This pushes some of the logic into the Python code,
 * but does mean that load errors don't corrupt the whole database.
