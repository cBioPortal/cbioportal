The samples in a published dataset are usually a subset of the Firehose Legacy dataset, since manuscripts were often written before TCGA completed their goal of sequencing 500 tumors.","There can be differences between Firehose Legacy and published data. For example, the mutation data in the publication usually underwent more QC, and false positives might have been removed or, in rare cases, false negatives added. RNA-Seq and copy-number values may also differ slightly, as different versions of analysis pipelines could have been used. Additionally, due to additional curation during the publication process, the clinical data for the publication may be of higher quality or may contain a few more data elements, sometimes derived from the genomic data (e.g., genomic subtypes).","The TCGA PanCancer Atlas datasets derive from an effort to unify TCGA data across all tumor types. Publications resulting from this effort can be found at the TCGA PanCancer Atlas site. In the cBioPortal, data from the PanCancer Atlas is divided by tumor type, but these studies have uniform clinical elements, consistent processing and normalization of mutations, copy number, mRNA data and are ideally processed for comparative analyses.","TCGA studies not sourced from GDC have the original mutation data generated by the individual TCGA sequencing centers. The source of the data is the Broad Firehose (or the publication pages for data that matches a specific manuscript). These data are usually a combination of two mutation callers, e.g. a variant caller like MuTect plus an indel caller.

While most users interact with this web service indirectly while visiting cBioPortal web pages, it is possible to access this web service directly. Direct access to the web service is appealing for those users with an interest in mining or analyzing cBioPortal data beyond the confines of a web browser, such as from ‚ÄòR‚Äô or Python clients.","If your instance of the cBioPortal will not require user authorization(login), direct access to the web service is available without any additional server configuration or client side prerequisites. However, if your instance of the cBioPortal will require login, additional data access token server configuration is necessary before direct access to the web service is available to your users. Additionally, prior to web service access, clients will need to obtain a data access token and present this token with each web service request.","This document contains information for both cBioPortal administrators and users. For administrators, this document describes how to configure an instance of the cBioPortal with data access token support. For users, this document provides details about how to obtain a data access token and present it with a web service request (see Using Data Access Tokens)."]},{"l":"Configuring Data Access Tokens within cBioPortal"},{"l":"Implementations","p":["The cBioPortal codebase comes with three different data access token implementations, each of which come with strengths and weaknesses.","The first implementation based on JSON Web Token(JWT) technology, is appealing because the data access token contains all the information required to validate the token during a web service request. When a data access token is generated by the cBioPortal, its expiration date is inserted into the token. The data access token is then signed and encrypted before presenting it to the user. When the data access token is presented in a subsequent web service request, the cBioPortal is able to inspect the token and determine its validity before satisfying the request. The downside to this implementation is that since the data access token is self-validating, no information about the token is stored in the database. This means there is no way to revoke a data access token in the event that it has been compromised or limit the number of data access tokens per user.","The second implementation based on Universally unique identifier(UUID) technology, allows for greater control over the data access token at the cost of additional database support. Unlike JWT based data access tokens which are self-validating, a UUID based token is a string representation of a unique number. When a data access token is generated by the cBioPortal, a record is inserted into the data_access_tokens database table:","In addition to storing the token (the unique number), its creation and expiration dates along with the associated username is also stored prior to presenting it to the user. When the data access token is presented in a subsequent web service request, the cBioPortal compares the token presented in the request against this table for validity. If the token exists in the table and has not yet expired, the request will be satisfied. The creation date is used by the cBioPortal when a user requests a new data access token. Based on the server configuration, if the number of outstanding data access tokens together with this new one exceeds the number of allowable data access tokens per user, the cBioPortal may refuse to present a new one or it may invalidate the oldest one before presenting the new one to the user.","A third implementation makes use of an external OAuth2-authentication provider and can integrate with single-sign on (SSO) solutions. The OAuth2 provider provides users with an offline token that does not allow for direct access to protected cBioPortal resources. Instead, the offline token is passed to the OAuth2 authorization server that returns an access token, a short-lived permission to access cBioPortal resources. The access token contains up-to-date user permissions (the studies that the user is permitted to view). This implementation ensures that any changes of user permissions registered at the authentication provider are effective immediately and do not rely on the expiration date of the token of the user. At any moment OAuth2 offline tokens can be revoked by the Authentication provider on a per-user basis.","A step-by-step guide to configure KeyCloak to provide OAuth2 client functionality can be found in Authenticating and Authorizing Users via keycloak."]},{"l":"Modifying Configuration","p":["Default Value: 1","Default Value: 2592000 (30 days)","Default Value: anonymousUser","Default Value: none","Default Value: resource_access::cbioportal::roles","Default Value: This value is specified by the authentication provider.","Description: ::-separated path to array with user roles in JWT token returned by Keycloak.","Description: A list of users that should not be allowed to download a data access token.","Description: Identifier of the OAuth2 client of the authentication provider.","Description: Name of the issuer of the tokens.

For example, a data access token may have an expiration date of 30 days after its creation date or 300 days.

For example: parts of the gene that code for proteins (exons) can be included or excluded through a process known as alternative splicing. Each of the different resulting proteins is called an isoform. A single mutation can impact the isoforms differently. E.g. in one isoform it might change a P to a T, but in the other isoform that particular exon does not get included and it is therefore not changing the amino acid sequence at all. In cBioPortal for convenience sake we assign a single gene symbol + protein change to each mutation. For most cases this works well because there is only one protein isoform relevant in a clinical setting. There are of course exceptions and we are therefore working on improving this representation. An explanation of the relation between transcripts and protein isoforms can be found in the next section."]},{"i":"what-is-a-transcript","l":"What is a transcript?","p":["DNA is transcribed to a pre-mRNA transcript which includes intron and exon regions. Splicing and other processes then take place to form the resulting mature mRNA transcript that only contains exons, which subsequently can be translated to a protein sequence. An mRNA transcript can thus be associated with a specific protein isoform. The Ensembl database assigns ids for these transcript with names like ENSTxxx. You can see this on e.g. the Ensembl website for the BRAF gene:","The transcript ENST00000288602.6 is 2480 base pairs long (nucleotides ACGT) and the associated protein isoform is 766 amino acids (V/P/etc). You can see we are showing that same transcript and protein isoform on cBioPortal:","For each gene name in cBioPortal a canonical/default transcript is assigned. These assignments are stored in Genome Nexus and explained below. Although cBioPortal does not store changes to different transcripts/isoforms for each mutation in the database itself, it does allow viewing them on the Mutations Tab by re-annotating the mutations on the fly through Genome Nexus whenever a user clicks on the transcript dropdown."]},{"l":"Transcript Assignment","p":["The cBioPortal database stores one gene + protein change annotation for each mutation event in the database. To allow comparing mutation data across studies it is important to annotate the mutation data (be it in MAF or VCF format) in the same way, otherwise the gene + protein changes can mean entirely different things. For all public studies stored in datahub we leverage Genome Nexus to do so. Genome Nexus assigns one canonical Ensembl Transcript + gene name + protein change for each mutation. You can find the mapping of hugo symbol to transcript id here. There are two sets of default transcripts: uniprot and mskcc. We recommend to use the mskcc set of transcripts when starting from scratch, since these are more up to date and correspond to transcripts that were chosen as relevant for clinical sequencing at MSKCC. The uniprot set of transcripts was constructed several years ago, but we are no longer certain about the logic on how to reconstruct them hence they are not being kept up to date. One can see the differences between the two in this file. For the public cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org) and datahub we are using mskcc, for the GENIE cBioPortal ( https://genie.cbioportal.org) we still use uniprot. As of cBioPortal v5 the default is mskcc for local installations. Prior to v5 it was uniprot. We recommend that people upgrading to v5 consider migrating to mskcc as well (see migration guide and the properties reference docs)."]},{"l":"How default transcript assignment affects the Mutations Tab","p":["The Mutations Tab shows the full protein sequence. The one shown by default is the canonical transcript ( mskcc or uniprot depending on configuration). The mutations are drawn on the lollipop based on the protein position found in the cBioPortal database. For the public cBioPortal all mutation data in MAF format are annotated using Genome Nexus to add the gene and protein change columns. This is then imported into the cBioPortal database. Whether you choose to use the set of uniprot or mskcc transcripts, make sure to indicate it in the [Genome Nexus Annotation Pipeline]( https://github.com/genome-nexus/genome- nexus-annotation-pipeline#maf-annotation)(--isoform-override mskcc or uniprot) when annotating as well as in the properties file of cBioPortal. That way the Mutations Tab will show the correct canonical transcript. Note that whenever somebody uses the dropdown on the Mutations Tab to change the displayed transcript, Genome Neuxs re-annotates all mutations on the fly. The browser sends over the genomic location (chrom,start,end,ref, alt) to get the protein change information for each transcript. Since many of the annotations are for the canonical transcripts only we are currently hiding annotations for non-canonical transcripts."]},{"l":"Plans for default transcripts","p":["We are planning to move to a single set of default transcripts over time. Prior to v5 uniprot was used for the public facing portals and local installations. Our plan is to use mskcc everywhere and eventually we will most likely move to MANE. MANE is only available for grch38 and since most of our data is for grch37 this is currently not feasible. Whichever set of transcripts you choose to use, make sure to indicate so in the Genome Nexus Annotation Pipeline(--isoform-override mskcc or uniprot) and put the same set of transcripts in the properties file of cBioPortal, such that the Mutations Tab will show the correct canonical transcript (currently defaults to mskcc). The re-annotation of mutations only happens once a user clicks to change the transcript, which is why it's important that the protein change in the database is for the specific transcript displayed first."]}],[{"l":"Import OncoKB annotations as custom driver annotations","p":["The Annotation Configuration menu in Study View and Group Comparison is available only when custom driver annotations are present in the cBioPortal database for the genes in the study (or studies).

Incremental improvements on existing features are often easier to accomplish and require input from fewer people. Most minor changes can be submitted as a Pull Request. If the proposed feature would require one or more days of work it makes sense to connect on slack to discuss the idea. For more complex new features that require weeks of work or more, it is best to get input from several people in the cBioPortal community, including people with a deep understanding of the cBioPortal product and its users as well as the engineers that write the software. In that case we often start out with a Request For Comments document that describes the feature in more detail, see our list of RFCs for some examples. The community can then help guide the feature development in the right direction.","During this process you will most likely receive some pointers which part of the stack you will be editing (see Architecture Overview). This will be helpful when actually starting your implementation and figuring out how to set up your development environment. For many features it is not necessary to understand all parts of the stack, so seeking out advice on this is highly recommended.","Before you start implementing a more complex feature, ideally many of these things are clear:","Who can you contact for help?","Who will be helping to review the code?","What part of the stack will you work on?","Gold stars if you already start thinking about:","How do we release the feature incrementally?","When is feature development done?","See more thoughts about these topics further below"]},{"l":"Starting Implementation","p":["Once you are ready to start implementing, the first thing is to set up the development environment. We strive to make this as easy as possible, but it can often still take some time so definitely reach out if you run into issues. If you haven't submitted a Pull Request to cBioPortal before, it might make sense to look at some good first issues before starting with your feature. This will help to get some familiarity with the process of proposing a change, getting it reviewed, making edits and getting it to production. Don't pick anything too complicated for a first issue, it could be as simple as fixing some typos in the README."]},{"l":"During Implementation","p":["The most important part during implementation is communication. Continue getting feedback as your implementation evolves. One of the best ways to do this is to fully integrate into the development team while you work on a feature. Anybody is welcome to join our weekly planning meeting (Tuesdays 11AM-12PM Eastern Time) and our daily standups 2.30-3PM Eastern Time. Please reach out on slack to get an invite. If these times are not ideal or you're working on the feature more sporadically then it's totally fine to skip them."]},{"l":"Plan to release to production early","p":["Don't wait until the feature is fully finished to get feedback from the product team and the engineering team. Think about ways we can release a portion of the feature to production without finishing the entire thing. We have found feature flags to work well here. Instead of using long running feature branches we try to add a configuration property that allows us to turn the feature on or off. That way portions of the code can be released to production early on. We want to avoid working on some piece of code for more than a week or so without being able to release it. For instance: if one is trying to add some new tab on the Patient View Page, one could start with adding the on/off configuration switch for this tab. That could be released to production relatively quickly."]},{"l":"Regression Testing","p":["Make sure to think about ways to incorporate testing for your feature.

Shared publicly, in case it may be of use. Instructions on how to deploy cBioPortal can be found elsewhere, see e.g. Deploying the web application and Deploy using Docker.","We deploy the master branch of backend and the master branch of frontend to production. The public portal ( https://www.cbioportal.org) runs on AWS EKS. The configuration can be found in the knowledgesystems repo:","https://github.com/knowledgesystems/knowledgesystems-k8s-deployment","Other internal MSK portals run on AWS EKS as well.","The frontend and backend can be upgraded independently. We have the following events that can require a new deployment:","New frontend commit in master","New backend commit in master"]},{"l":"New frontend commit in master","p":["Currently we are auto-deploying the frontend master branch to netlify: https://frontend.cbioportal.org. So any change should be automatically built and deployed to the relevant portals if the frontend configuration has been set up properly. Do note that the current build time for the frontend project is ~ 15 minutes or so. To see what frontend commit is deployed, check window.FRONTEND_COMMIT in the console of the browser."]},{"l":"Public Portal Frontend URL","p":["The public portal is on AWS and running inside a Kubernetes cluster. The URL that it gets the frontend version from is here:","https://github.com/knowledgesystems/knowledgesystems-k8s-deployment/search?q=-Dfrontend.url&unscoped_q=-Dfrontend.url","This should be a URL pointing to netlify."]},{"l":"Internal Portal Frontend URL","p":["For the internally runnning portals the frontend.url is defined in the application.properties file in the mercurial portal-configuration repo. If set up correctly, this should point to a file on both dashi and dashi2 that in turn points to a netlify frontend URL. The reason we have a separate file with the URL in it is that it allows us to update the frontend URL without redeploying the backend."]},{"l":"New backend commit in master","p":["A new backend commit usually also means a new frontend change is necessary. For this reason the following sections assume that's the case."]},{"l":"Public Portal Backend Upgrade","p":["Once the backend repo has been tagged on github, a docker image gets build on Docker Hub automatically. It can take ~ 5 min before the image is available. You can check here what the status of the builds is: https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Docker+Image+CI%22.","After that, if you have access to the kubernetes cluster you can change the image in the configuration of the kubernetes cluster:","https://github.com/knowledgesystems/knowledgesystems-k8s-deployment/blob/master/public-eks/cbioportal-prod/cbioportal_spring_boot.yaml","point this line, to the new tag on docker hub e.g.:","Make sure it is an image with the postfix -web-shenandoah.

CBioPortal has multiple MySQL databases (all using AWS RDS) backing different portals. Similarly, there are multiple importers responsible for loading portal-specific data. Every database must be manually migrated on an individual basis; all importers/data fetchers can be updated simultaneously through an existing deployment script.","Before upgrading, make sure to turn off import jobs in the crontab and alert the backend pipelines team (Avery, Angelica, Rob, Manda).","To access the crontab, log in to pipelines, log in as cbioportal_importer: sudo su - cbioportal_importer, and run crontab -e.
