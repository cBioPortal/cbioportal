# [Introduction](introduction)

This page describes the various files available for download.

# [Seed Database](seed-database)

The files are MySQL database dump for seeding a new instance of the cBioPortal.  They contain all the necessary background data for a properly functioning cBioPortal website, including cancer types, gene, uniprot-mappings, drug, pdb and network data.  The files are available for download here:

- [cbioportal-seed SQL (.gz) file - part1 (no pdb_ tables)](https://storage.googleapis.com/cbiostorage-1/seedDB/v1/cbioportal-seed_no-pdb_hg19.sql.gz)
- [cbioportal-seed SQL (.gz) file - part2 (only pdb_ tables)](https://storage.googleapis.com/cbiostorage-1/seedDB/v1/cbioportal-seed_only-pdb.sql.gz)

# [MAF Example](maf-example)

This is an example of the file format used to import mutation data into the cBioPortal.  It is derived from the [Mutation Annotation Format](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/Mutation+Annotation+Format+%28MAF%29+Specification) created as part of the [TCGA](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+Home) project.  The example MAF file is available for download here:
