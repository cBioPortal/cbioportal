# [MAF Example](maf-example)

This is an example of the file format used to import mutation data into the cBioPortal.  It is derived from the [Mutation Annotation Format](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/Mutation+Annotation+Format+%28MAF%29+Specification) created as part of the [TCGA](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+Home) project.  The example MAF file is available for download here:
