Another major update, with the following new features and data:

* New and improved mutation details, with sorting and filtering capabilities.
* In collaboration with Bilkent University, we have added a new *network* tab to our results pages.  The network tab enables users to visualize, analyze and filter cancer genomic data in the context of pathways and interaction networks derived from [Pathway Commons](http://www.pathwaycommons.org).
* Survival data is now available for many tumor types
* RPPA data is now available for over 2000 samples in six tumor types
* Based on the October Firehose run
* Many new and updated MAF files

# October 18, 2011

This release adds the following new data:

* Based on the September Firehose run with new tumor types (Bladder, Liver, Low grade glioma)
* Latest MAF files from the COADREAD and LUSC analysis working groups
* Mutation Assessor links for all missense mutations
* RPPA data for kidney clear cell and endometrial cancer
* GBM case lists for transcriptional subtypes and CIMP

# September 12, 2011

This is a major update, which includes the following main changes:

* New tumor types and data: Now ~3500 samples from 12 tumor types, including mutation data for 8 tumor types.
* RPPA data support - the Portal currently has data for ovarian and breast cancer.
* Access control via [OpenID](http://openid.net/).
* The code for the cBio Portal has now been fully open sourced, and made available at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/cbio-cancer-genomics-portal/).  If you would like to join our open source efforts and make the portal even better, drop us an email.

This is the initial release of the cBio TCGA Cancer Genomics Portal. The portal contains data from all completed and ongoing TCGA projects. All data is automatically imported from the output of the Broad Firehose.

This release includes data on 2531 samples from 11 tumor types.
