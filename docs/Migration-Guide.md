# Migration Guide

This page describes various changes deployers will need to make as they deploy newer versions of the portal.

## v5 -> v6

- Override Spring Application Properties:
  - The process of overriding properties has been updated for example previously users could do the following `java -Xms2g -Xmx4g -Dauthenticate=saml -jar webapp-runner.jar`.
  Now users must pass Spring Application properties after the `.jar` and replace `-Dauthenticate=false` with `--authenticate=false`. 
  For example `java -Xms2g -Xmx4g -jar cbioportal/target/cbioportal-exec.jar --spring.config.location=cbioportal/application.properties --authenticate=false`
- `portal.properties` migration needed:
  - `portal.properties` has been renamed to `application.properties`. This is the Spring Boot default name 
  - `authenticate` values of `googleplus`, `social_auth_google` and `social_auth_microsoft` have been replaced by `optional_oauth2`
    - If you used this property before without authorization (unlikely, only the public cBioPortal instance uses this), add the property `always_show_study_group=PUBLIC` and confirm  that all studies in your database you'd like to be be public have `GROUPS` values set to `PUBLIC`
- `Redis HTTP Session`
  - To disable redis session (Must be disabled if redis is not setup) `spring.autoconfigure.exclude=org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.data.redis.RedisAutoConfiguration`
  - To enable `spring.data.redis.host=localhost` `spring.data.redis.port=6379`
- `Security` changes:
  - Properties used to configure Security have changed see [security.properties.EXAMPLE](deployment/customization/security.properties-Reference.md)
  - `SAML` changes:
    - need to generate new keys (`.jks` no longer works)
       - if you have an existing client, update saml keys with newly generate keys
    - if you have an existing client, update redirect_uri to be without port 443
    - You can now use a URL here, instead of metadata XML: `spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.cbio-saml-idp.assertingparty.metadata-uri`

## v5.3 -> v5.4

- Remove `db.host` and `db.portal_db_name` and `db.use_ssl` properties from the _portal.properties_ file or JVM
  parameters. Update property `db.connection_string` to encode the hostname, port, database and other parameters
  according to [Database Settings](deployment/customization/portal.properties-Reference.md#Database-Settings) documentation and pass via
  _portal.properties_ file or as JVM parameter.

## v4 -> v5

- All fusion profiles are now required to be migrated to structural variant format. One can use
  this [migration tool](https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub-study-curation-tools/tree/master/fusion-to-sv-converter)
  to migrate the fusion files.
- All fusion files on [datahub](https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub) were migrated to the structural variant format
  and their molecular profile ids were renamed from `{study_id}_fusion` to `{study_id}_structural_variants`. If you are
  using these datahub files one would need to re-import them.
- Study view user setting will be outdated after migration, please follow `Clear Study View User settings` section
  in [Session Service Management](Session-Service-Management.md#Clear-Study-View-User-settings)
- The new default set of transcripts for each gene has changed from `uniprot` to `mskcc`. See
  the [Mutation Data Annotation Section](./mutation-data-transcript-annotation.md) for more details. To keep the old set
  of default transcripts add the property `genomenexus.isoform_override_source=uniprot`
  to [the properties file](https://docs.cbioportal.org/deployment/customization/portal.properties-reference/#properties).

See the [v5.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/releases/tag/v5.0.0) for more details.

## v3 -> v4

- Introduces `logback` package for logging. If you don't have any custom log4j.properties file, no changes are necessary
- Cleans up several old databases ([PR](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/pull/9360)). In theory the migration
  should be seamless, since the docker container detects an old database version and migrates it automatically.

See the [v4.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/releases/tag/v4.0.0) for more details.

## v2 -> v3

- Session service is now required to be set up. You can't run it without session service. The recommended way to run
  cBioPortal is to use the Docker Compose instructions.

## v1 -> v2

- Changes cBioPortal to a Single Page App (SPA) written in React, Mobx and bootstrap that uses a REST API. It shouldn't
  change anything for a deployer.
