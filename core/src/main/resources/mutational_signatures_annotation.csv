Signature_24,Signature 24 (Aflatoxin),"Signature 24 has been observed in a subset of liver cancers. Signature 24 has been found in cancer samples with known exposures to aflatoxin. Additionally, the pattern of mutations exhibited by the signature is consistent with that previous observed in experimental systems exposed to aflatoxin. It exhibits a very strong transcriptional strand bias for C>A mutations indicating guanine damage that is being repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair.",https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt
Signature_25,Signature 25 (Unknown),Signature 25 has been observed in Hodgkin lymphomas. The aetiology of Signature 25 remains unknown. It exhibits transcriptional strand bias for T>A mutations. This signature has only been identified in Hodgkin’s cell lines. Data is not available from primary Hodgkin lymphomas.,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt
Signature_26,Signature 26 (MMR),"Signature 26 has been found in breast cancer, cervical cancer, stomach cancer and uterine carcinoma. Signature 26 is believed to be associated with defective DNA mismatch repair. Signature 26 is one of four mutational signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and is often found in the same samples as Signatures 6, 15 and 20.",https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt
Signature_27,Signature 27 (Unknown),Signature 27 has been observed in a subset of kidney clear cell carcinomas. The aetiology of Signature 27 remains unknown. It exhibits very strong transcriptional strand bias for T>A mutations. Signature 27 is associated with high numbers of small (shorter than 3bp) insertions and deletions at mono/polynucleotide repeats.,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt
Signature_28,Signature 28 (Unknown),Signature 28 has been observed in a subset of stomach cancers. The aetiology of Signature 28 remains unknown.,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt
Signature_29,Signature 29 (Tobacco),Signature 29 has been observed only in gingivo-buccal oral squamous cell carcinoma. Signature 29 has been found in cancer samples from individuals with a tobacco chewing habit. Signature 29 exhibits transcriptional strand bias for C>A mutations indicating guanine damage that is most likely repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Signature 29 is also associated with CC>AA dinucleotide substitutions. The Signature 29 pattern of C>A mutations due to tobacco chewing appears different from the pattern of mutations due to tobacco smoking reflected by Signature 4.,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt
Signature_30,Signature 30 (Unknown),Signature 30 has been observed in a small subset of breast cancers. The aetiology of Signature 30 remains unknown.,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt
