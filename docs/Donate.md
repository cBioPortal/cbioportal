## The cBioPortal Foundation

The mission of cBioPortal Foundation is to support the development and adoption of the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, open-source software for the interactive exploration of multidimensional cancer genomics data sets. The cBioPortal aims to significantly lower the barriers between complex genomic data and cancer researchers by providing rapid, intuitive, and high-quality access to molecular profiles and clinical attributes from large-scale cancer genomics projects, and by doing so, empower researchers to translate these rich data sets into biologic insights and clinical applications.

The cBioPortal Foundation will help further the mission of cBioPortal by supporting hackathons, user meetings, internships and other activities.
