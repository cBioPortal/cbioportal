# Users, admins: DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE! 
# These are the combinations of GENETIC_ALTERATION_TYPE, DATATYPE and STABLE_ID that will
# be allowed by the validator. Changing this file is not recommended by end users as parts of the 
# cBioPortal code currently depend on some of these stable IDs to be exactly as they are specified
# here. The validator will check if the users used the right combinations and can also warn them
# when specific important combinations were found to be missing in their study directory.
