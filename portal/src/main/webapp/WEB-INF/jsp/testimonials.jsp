	    <p>"Whenever bench scientists ask me how they can look at TCGA data, I've never
            had a good answer for them. Now I do. The cBio Portal meets a critical need--it is the
            interface that the cancer research community needs to access the wealth of TCGA. Even as a
            computational biologist, I use it to follow-up on genes of interest. It makes querying
            the data much less painful."

        <p>"As a bench biologist with primary aim of determining gene aberrations in GBM, I found
            your site absolutely fantastic! Thank you! I have to reiterate how awesome and user-friendly
            your group has made this site - finally accomplishing the goal of having data easily accessible
            and meaningful."

        <p>"This portal is truly the greatest thing since sliced bread. I am making discoveries with it not only in glioblastoma, my primary focus, but in other cancers as well -- it's all so easy with this fantastic tool. And I am enjoying showing it to my colleagues, whose jaws also drop. Thank you a thousand times over for this beautiful public resource. I am looking forward to citing this soon in an upcoming paper..."
