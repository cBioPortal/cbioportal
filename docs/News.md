## January 11, 2019
 *   **Public Release 5.0 of AACR Project GENIE:**
     *   The first set of cancer genomic data aggregated through AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) was released to the global community in January 2017. The forth data set, GENIE 4.0-public, was released in July 2018 adding more than 7,800 records to the database. The combined data set now includes more than 59,000 de-identified genomic records collected from patients who were treated at each of the consortium's participating institutions, making it among the largest fully public cancer genomic data sets released to date.  This data will be released to the public every six months.
 *   More detailed information can be found in the [AACR GENIE Data Guide](http://www.aacr.org/Research/Research/Documents/GENIE%20Data%20Guide.pdf).  In addition to accessing the data via the cBioPortal, users can download the data directly from [Sage Bionetworks](http://synapse.org/genie). Users will need to create an account for either site and agree to the [terms of access](http://www.aacr.org/Documents/Terms%20of%20Access.pdf).
