/* HotspotSet
 * 
 * This class is designed for quickly querying whether a mutation is a hotspot.
 * It's supported to query by a single residue position, or a range of residue positions,
 *  and it does a binary search to quickly check whether the input range or position
 *  overlaps with any hotspot regions specified in the constructor.
 * 
 * The class does not support telling you exactly which input intervals are overlapped-with,
 *  that information is lost. But it will tell you true or false: whether there was some input interval
 *  that is overlapped-with.
