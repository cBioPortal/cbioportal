Are you new to cBioPortal? Welcome! We have a few options to help you get started.

If you have an hour, we highly recommend watching the recording of our Introduction to cBioPortal webinar ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPIAxH--cSo) or [bilibili.com](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1tf4y1m7Lp)).

Don't have an hour? Review our tutorial slides for exploring a study ([Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_OGK69lO4Z62WaxHHkNYmWvY0LQN2v0slfaLyY1_IQ0) or [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/master/docs/tutorials/cBioPortal%20Tutorial%201%20Single%20Study%20Exploration.pdf)) and running a query ([Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y9UTIr5vHmsNVWqtGTVGgiuYX9wkK_a_RPNYiR8kYD8) or [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/master/docs/tutorials/cBioPortal%20Tutorial%202%20Single%20Study%20Query.pdf))

Or, watch two of our short how-to videos which demonstrate how to explore a study ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ffDgkqDWc)) and how to run a query ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH-kY5usA70)).
