It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and ponatinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response.

Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. Treating cyclin D3 knockout mice with the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of a Notch-driven model of T-ALL.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and ponatinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response.

One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter region. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.

The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported.

EGFR	1956	T790M	Lung Cancer	1324	Gefitinib,AEE788	Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	Lung cancers can accumulate activating mutations in oncogenes such as EGFR. The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates WT EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.	18227510	Yun et al., 2008, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. The third generation TKI's are being developed with this resistance problem in mind, and early stage experiments have shown some efficacy of these drugs in previously resistant tumors with mutant EGFR.

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. The third generation TKI's are being developed with this resistance problem in mind, and early stage experiments have shown some efficacy of these drugs in previously resistant tumors with mutant EGFR.

Identified EGFR aberrations included EGFRvIII positivity, EGFR gene amplification and three somatic EGFR mutations.	26423602	Alshami et al., 2015, Oncotarget	2	accepted	773	312	19	7	55087058	55223523			ENST00000275493.2					75	GRCh37	The EGFRvIII variant is an oncogenic mutation that has been reported in several cancers including glioblastoma multiforme, breast, lung, head and neck, ovarian and prostate. In high-grade gliomas, EGFRvIII has been reported in about 30% of cases with EGFR amplification. The EGFRvIII mutation leads to deletion of the receptor ectodomain exons 2-7. The presence of this variant has been linked with clinical response to EGFR TKI. (Arteaga CL, Engelman JA; Cancer Cell. 2014 Mar 17;25(3):282-303. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2014.02.025.)

However, p16-positive oropharyngeal HNSSC still had better PFS and OS than p16-positive non-oropharyngeal HNSSC.	25267748	Chung et al., 2014, J. Clin.

CDKN2A (p16) and p53 are inactivated through HPV proteins E6 and E7 and therefore not altered on expression level in HPV-associated carcinomas. However, there is no perfect overlap between p16 expression and HPV status with some 10-12.5% of HPV-negative tumors expressing p16. (Seiwert, T JCO December 10, 2014 vol. 32 no. 35 3914-3916, doi: 10.1200/JCO.2014.57.9268). p16 positivity is a well-established positive prognostic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the primary and, as increasing evidence suggests, recurrent/metastatic disease settings. Predictive information from HPV status have not been established to date. A lack of benefit from EGFR-inhibitors has been proposed by some studies. Other studies were not able to reproduce this finding.

Of the 98 patients, 31 patients received cetuximab, of these, 9 (29.0%) had KRAS p.G13D mutations. Univariate analysis did not show any differences between these groups. Multivariate analysis showed a trend towards better PFS among patients with a G13D mutation (PFS: HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.08-1.10; P=0.07; OS: HR=0.23; 95% CI: 0.04-1.54; P=0.13).	26623049	Osumi et al., 2015, Mol Clin Oncol	2	accepted	806	81	30	12	25398281	25398281	C	T	ENST00000256078.4					75	GRCh37	While the KRAS G13 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G12 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, results are conflicting with retrospective analyses suggesting a better response to EGFR-Inhibition. A recent prospective phase-II study (12 patients, Schirripa et. al.) could not reproduce this finding and another prospective phase II trial is currently ongoing.

Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.

Cancer	2	accepted	886	306	20	17	37856333	37884915			ENST00000269571.5					75	GRCh37	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.

Another study reports FGFR1 expression in 35% of primary HNSSC (353 patients) (Göke et. al.). In both studies, FGFR1 gene amplification and expression do not correlate well with about 35% of samples with FGFR1 amplification overexpressing FGFR1 (Göke et. al.). FGFR1 expression also correlated with sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors in preclinical models of lung cancer (Wynes et. al.), HNSSC (Göke et. al.) and urothelial carcinoma (Lamont et. al.).

EGFR	1956	Y1092 PHOSPHORYLATION	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	Erlotinib,Gefitinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	While EGFR mutation is a strong predictive factor for EGFR inhibition, some patients with EGFR wild-type also respond.  The authors investigated whether phosphorylated EGFR could be a potential predictive biomarker in patients with wild-type EGFR. Phosphorylation of Y1068 (assessed by IHC) was associated with improved progression free survival (PFS) in 205 patients with stage IIb and IV NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib) compared to phospho-Y1068 negative patients (median PFS 7.0 months vs. 1.2 months, P < 0.001). In this group, 92 (44.9%) were EGFR mutant. In a subgroup of patients with wild-type EGFR, phospho-Y1068 expression positive patients had a significantly prolonged PFS (4.2 months vs.1.2 months P < 0.001) compared with those without phospho-Y1068 expression.	22901364	Wang et al., 2012, J.

FOXP3	50943	EXPRESSION	Breast Cancer	1612	Epirubicin	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	1,097 patients with breast cancer were evaluated for FOXP3 expression by IHC. FOXP3 expression was found in 405 tumor samples and associated with improved OS in patients treated with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy (6 cycles of 'FEC100' aka epirubicin + cyclophosphamide + 5-fluorouracil) but not in patients treated with sequential anthracycline->taxane (3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel). In-vitro experiments confirmed that FOXP3 expression enhance anthracycline efficacy. The in vitro data consisted of testing the sensitivity of various breast cancer cell lines to anthracyclines after treatment with valproic acid (which increases FOXP3 expression). The authors observed that, while valproic acid has no intrinsic cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, it enhanced the cytotoxic effect of epirubicin specifically in cell lines where FOXP3 expression was increased.	22431701	Ladoire et al., 2012, Ann.

These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.

The results are interpreted as showing no added benefit for labatinib addition to trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment context.

In this study of HER2 positive metastatic BC which had progressed on trastuzumab, two arms were compared: lapatinib vs. lapatinib + trastuzumab. Progression free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. For 296 patients, 148 in each arm, median PFS of 8.1 weeks for lapatinib and 12.0 for combination therapy was observed (P=0.008).  The authors conclude that in the context of metastatic trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive BC, trastuzumab with lapatinib TKI addition is a favorable treatment.	20124187	Blackwell et al., 2010, J.

Differences were not statistically significant, and afatanib patients experienced more adverse effects.  While Afatanib did show response in HER2 breast cancer patients, it was not better than investigator's treatment choice and the investigators state that no further development of afatinib for HER2 breast cancer will be planned.	26596672	Cortés et al., 2015, Lancet Oncol.	3	accepted	1011	306	20	17	37856333	37884915			ENST00000269571.5					75	GRCh37	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered.

It was thought that the wider range of ErbB family blocking and irreversible properties of afatinib could be beneficial in trastuzumab resistant cancer cells, since ErbB family members are thought to play a role in trastuzumab resistance. Primary endpoint was intention-to-treat group PFS. 339 patients were assigned to afatanib + vinorelbine and 169  to trastuzumab + vinorelbine.  Recruitment was stopped prematurely when it was deemed unlikely that the increased PFS would be seen in the afatinib group. Median PFS was 5.5 months in the afatinib group and 5.6 months in the trastuzumab group.  Afatanib plus vinorelbine was less well tolerated than trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, and the authors conclude that trastuzumab remains the best choice for treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC.	26822398	Harbeck et al., 2016, Lancet Oncol.	4	accepted	1012	232	20	17	37844167	37884614			ENST00000584601.1					75	GRCh37		Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/20/summary/variants/232/summary/evidence/1012/summary#evidence	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/20/summary/variants/232/summary#variant	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu#/events/genes/20/summary#gene

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Gastric Adenocarcinoma	3717	Lapatinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	TyTAN, a Phase III study in Asian patients, looked at addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib to chemptherapy in advanced HER2 positive gastric cancer.  Primary endpoint was Overall Survival (OS).  Participants had progressed under previous treatment and only a small percentage had seen first line trastuzumab.  Patients were a mix of those having undergone gastrectomy and not.  OS was not significantly  different in the ITT population, but certain subpopulations showed significant differences.  In the subset of patients showing a stronger immunohistochemistry result for HER2 (IHC3+), progression free survival was significantly different at 5.6 months for lapatinib + pacitaxel vs. 4.2 months for pacitaxel alone.  The authors conclude that proof of concept for lapatanib addition to chemotherapy for certain subgroups is provided in this study.	24868024	Satoh et al., 2014, J. Clin.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.

In the first case, a 50 pack-year patient showed intense non-mutant HER2 expression by IHC without DNA amplification, and had undergone multiple prior lines of treatment.  With induction of trastuzumab and irinotecan treatment, tumor regression was observed with progression free survival of 4.5 months.  Case 2 involved a 68 year old never-smoker with relapsed SCLC.  Tumor showed HER2 positive SCLC cells with no amplification or mutation.  Third line trastuzumab plus irinotecan brought about some symptom improvement and PFS of 3.5 months.  While the efficacy of trastuzumab against NSCLC with elevated levels of wild-type HER2 expression remains unclear, the authors conclude that trastuzumab based therapy is a promising strategy for chemo-resistant SCLC.	25601188	Kinehara et al., 2015, Lung Cancer	4	accepted	1044	232	20	17	37844167	37884614			ENST00000584601.1					75	GRCh37		Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/20/summary/variants/232/summary/evidence/1044/summary#evidence	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/20/summary/variants/232/summary#variant	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu#/events/genes/20/summary#gene
ERBB2	2064	M774INSAYVM	Lung Adenocarcinoma	3910	Afatinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	A 55 year old heavily pretreated patient with equivocal HER2 overexpression (IHC2+ and no amplification in FISH) was found to have the HER2 YMVA kinase domain insertion.  Afatinib monotherapy resulted in resolution of symptoms and 10 months before progressive disease.  The patient was subsequently given trastuzumab with no response.  The observed efficacy of afatinib against M774insAYVM, and studies reporting afatinib activity against other variants in the HER2 kinase domain, are cited by the authors as motivation for the arm of NCI-MATCH focusing on afatinib and activating HER2 mutations.	26559459	Li et al., 2015, Lung Cancer	4	accepted	1045	414	20	17	37880993	37880994		GCTTACGTGATG	ENST00000269571.5					75	GRCh37	Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain occur at a 2-4% frequency in lung adenocarcinomas, the majority of which are in exon 20 as in-frame duplications or insertions in a small 8 codon region (774-781 or 775-782).

ERBB2	2064	M774INSAYVM	Lung Carcinoma	3905	Afatinib,Rapamycin	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	In mice, human HER2 with YVMA insertion was placed under a doxycycline-inducible, clara cell specific promoter. Induction of mutant HER2 in these mice drove rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors, where tumor maintenance was dependent on continued mutant HER2 induction by doxycycline.  It was found that treating these mice with afatinib and rapamycin had stronger effects than either treatment alone, including greater tumor regression and increased tumor necrosis.  The authors cite findings that HER2 activity in cancer may be highly dependent on its Akt/mTOR signaling arm as a possible explanation for this effect, and conclude that their results give rationale for testing of afatinib/rapamycin treatment in lung cancer.	19122144	Perera et al., 2009, Proc.

In this study using a panel of NSCLC HER2 overexpressing cell lines, antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) were observed in a HER2-expression dependant manner, with strongest effects in Calu-3 (high expressing) and no effects in Calu-6 (low expressing).  Trastuzumab did not show notable effects on cell growth in any tested cells.  HER2 positivity in NSCLC is fairly common at 2-20%.

FGF13	2258	CYTOPLASMIC EXPRESSION	Prostate Cancer	10283		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	243 primary PCa, 37 metastatic PCa, and  20  castration-resistant  PCa  (CRPC) specimens underwent IHC and microarray analysis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that FGF13 was detectable in the majority of human PCa samples, and FGF13 IHC scores were higher in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, in primary PCa, and in metastatic PCa than in benign prostatic tissue. There was a significant association between high cytoplasmic FGF13 staining and a risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that high cytoplasmic FGF13 staining was associated with BCR. Results were recapitulated in cell lines and public databases.	26891277	Yu et al., 2016, Int.

Cytogenetic studies have repeatedly demonstrated the t(X;18)(p11;q11) translocation in approximately 90% of both monophasic and biphasic synovial sarcomas. The fusion has clear diagnostic value, though the authors caution that it is not perfectly specific to synovial sarcomas, and suggest that demonstration of t(X;18) in a spindle cell neoplasm should be integrated with the morphology, immunoprofile, and clinical setting of the tumour.	11122430	Pfeifer et al., 2000, Histopathology	4	accepted	1069	448	5500														Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/5500/summary/variants/448/summary/evidence/1069/summary#evidence	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/5500/summary/variants/448/summary#variant	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu#/events/genes/5500/summary#gene

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Breast Cancer	1612	Trastuzumab,Docetaxel,Pertuzumab	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	CLEOPATRA (NCT00567190) was a Phase III, randomized and double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.  Patients were HER2-positive by IHC3+ or FISH, and patients who had received prior hormonal treatment or adjuvant/neo-adjuvant therapy with or without trastuzumab for longer than 12 months before randomization were also eligible.  The two arms of the study were trastuzumab and docetaxel with either placebo or pertuzumab.  Median PFS in the placebo arm was 12.4 months while in the petuzumab arm 18.5 months was achieved.  Median OS in the control arm was 40.8 months and 56.5 months with pertuzumab.  These strong results make a case for dual antibody blockade in first line treatments of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.	25693012	Swain et al., 2015, N. Engl. J.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Uterine Corpus Serous Adenocarcinoma	5750		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	In a study of 27 African American and caucasian patients, endometrial adenocarcinoma samples were assessed for HER2 via IHC staining, and association studies were performed using corresponding patient information.  Earlier deaths were seen with heavier HER2 expression.  Multivariate Cox regression indicated that shorter survival was associated with higher HER2 expression, and not with age or ethnicity, and that observed differences in survival rates between ethnicities can be ascribed to higher rates of HER2 overexpression in African American patients.  The authors conclude that high HER2 expression in USPC is associated with poor outcome and explains observed differences in outcome between ethnicities.	15746676	Santin et al., 2005, Am. J. Obstet.

Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.

The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.

ERBB2	2064	OVEREXPRESSION	Uterine Corpus Serous Adenocarcinoma	5750	Trastuzumab	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	HER2 expression in uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC) is thought to be associated with poor prognosis and may act as a targetable driver mutation in this cancer.  HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women.  This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH.  Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy.  Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL.  The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation.  Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered.  After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL.  The investigators conclude there is promise in trastuzumab-based therapies in advanced endometrial cancers, including USPC.	18555254	Santin et al., 2008, Int J Gynaecol Obstet	4	accepted	1097	232	20	17	37844167	37884614			ENST00000584601.1					75	GRCh37		Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/20/summary/variants/232/summary/evidence/1097/summary#evidence	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/20/summary/variants/232/summary#variant	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu#/events/genes/20/summary#gene
ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Endometrial Cancer	1380	Trastuzumab	Predictive	Does Not Support	Sensitivity	This phase II single arm study assessed trastuzumab monotherapy in HER2 positive endometrial cancers with tumor response as primary endpoint.  Participants had stage III, IV or recurrent HER2 positive endometrial cancer.  During the trial's initial phase, 23 of 132 patients screened met the criteria of IHC2+ or 3+ or FISH positivity for HER2 status.  In the absence of results, the trial entered phase B, where only patients with HER2 amplification by FISH were admitted.  The trial ended early due to poor accrual with 11 of 154 screened meeting the phase B criteria. No major objective tumor responses were observed in the study.  28% of the cancers were of the serous type that had shown trastuzumab response in case studies.  The investigators note that in other HER2 cancers, such as breast and gastrointestinal, trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been found most effective, and could warrant more study.  Currently a clinical trial (NCT01367002) is evaluating carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in uterine serous cancer.	19840887	Fleming et al., 2010, Gynecol.

NPM1	4869	EXON 12 MUTATION	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	Peripheral blood from NPM1 mutated AMLs was assessed for NPM1 mutation status at multiple time points using RT-qPCR with primers designed to amplify different mutant NPM1 transcripts. The test development cohort consisted of 194 cases and an independent validation cohort consisted of 91 cases. Persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in blood was present in 15% of the patients after the second chemotherapy cycle. This persistence was associated with a greater risk of relapse after 3 years of follow-up than was an absence of such transcripts (82% vs. 30%; hazard ratio, 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95 to 7.80; P<0.001) and a lower rate of survival (24% vs. 75%; hazard ratio for death, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.57 to 7.47; P<0.001). The presence of minimal residual disease was the only independent prognostic factor for death in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.57 to 9.15; P<0.001). On sequential monitoring of minimal residual disease, relapse was reliably predicted by a rising level of NPM1-mutated transcripts.	26789727	Ivey et al., 2016, N. Engl. J.

FLT3 status should also be evaluated as co-occurence with FLT3-ITD may impact prognosis. Exon 12 mutations have been identified as a predictor of good prognostic outcomes in the absence of FLT3-ITD. Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy. Cytoplasmic sequestration of NPM1 (NPM1c) is associated with a good response to induction therapy.

CEBPA	1050	N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119	OICR-9429	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	This preclinical study establishes that the p30 isoform of CEBPA expressed as a result of N-terminal truncating mutations preferentially interacts with WRD5, a component of the SET/MLL complex. Knockdown of WRD5 in 32D cells (mouse hematopoietic cell line) or transplanted primary mouse bone marrow expressing the p30 isoform restored myeloid differentiation in these cells. OICR-9429, a small molecule inhibitor of WRD5, and anti-WRD5 siRNAs selectively inhibited colony formation of mouse fetal liver cells homozygous for N-terminal CEBPA mutations but not wildtype colony formation. Finally, OICR-9429 reduced viability of primary human AML blasts harboring N-terminal domain CEBPA mutations in culture but not AML blasts with other mutations. Taken together, WRD5 inhibition is a potential therapeutic method for patients harboring N-terminal CEBPA mutations.	26167872	Grebien et al., 2015, Nat. Chem.

N-terminal frame shift mutations within amino acids 1-120 have been shown to disrupt expression of the full-length 42kDa isoform while maintaining expression of a 30kDa isoform (translated from the AUG at full-length protein isoform amino acid M120). This 30kDa isoform exhibits dominant negative activity.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Breast Cancer	1612	Neratinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	In this two arm, Phase III study (NCT00878709) of the efficacy of a 12 month course of the TKI neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer was assessed using invasive disease-free survival as primary endpoint.  HER2 positivity was assessed via FISH.  At 2 year follow-up, 70 vs. 109 disease-free survival events had occurred and disease-free survival rates were 93.9% vs. 91.6% (significant) in neratinib vs. placebo groups respectively.  Distant disease-free survival and time to distant recurrence were similar in both groups.  These results are an interesting contrast to results of long-term adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab (HERA) which did not show significant benefit.	26874901	Chan et al., 2016, Lancet Oncol.	4	accepted	1113	306	20	17	37856333	37884915			ENST00000269571.5					75	GRCh37	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.

These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.

Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations.

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.

A synthetic lethal screen using a total of 3,530 shRNAs to target 518 human kinases identified ERBB3 knockdown to confer sensitivity of selumetinib-resistant H358 cells (NSCLC cell line) to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. The dual EGFR-ERBB2 inhibitors afatinib and dacomitinib each showed synergy with MEK Inhibition via selumetinib in 4 KRAS mutant cell lines. Western blot evaluation of 9 NSCLC and 12 CRC cell lines showed ERBB3 expression correlated with the synergy score for combination afatinib and trametinib treatment. I.e. the synergy score was low in cells having low basal levels of ERBB3 protein and high for cells having high basal ERBB3 expression. Using selumetinib in patient-derived CRC xenografts or trametinib in NSCLC xenografts, MEK inhibition by selumetinib or trametinib in combination with afatinib more effectively inhibited increases in tumor volume than either monotherapy.	24685132	Sun et al., 2014, Cell Rep	3	accepted	1152	289	1733	12	56473645	56497289			ENST00000267101.3					75	GRCh37		N/A	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/1733/summary/variants/289/summary/evidence/1152/summary#evidence	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/1733/summary/variants/289/summary#variant	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu#/events/genes/1733/summary#gene

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. The third generation TKI's are being developed with this resistance problem in mind, and early stage experiments have shown some efficacy of these drugs in previously resistant tumors with mutant EGFR.

These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.

E545K, and possibly the other mutations in the E545 region, may present patients with a poorer prognosis than patients with either patients with other PIK3CA variant or wild-type PIK3CA. There is also data to suggest that E545/542 mutations may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab.

ALK	238	EML4-ALK	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	WHI-P154	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed using a lung adenocarcinoma specimen from a 67 year old NSCLC patient, and transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts which were assessed for transformed foci.  Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation.  BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC,  and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.	17625570	Soda et al., 2007, Nature	5	accepted	1188	5	1	2	42396490	42522656			ENST00000318522.5	2	29415640	29446394	ENST00000389048.3	75	GRCh37	The EML4-ALK fusion has been seen in non-small cell lung cancer and appears to be an alternative mechanism for ALK activation.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib.

PTEN	5728	MUTATION	Endometrial Carcinoma	2871	Everolimus	Predictive	Does Not Support	Sensitivity	Tumors from 35 patients (12 with partial response or stable disease) with advanced endometrial carcinoma were assessed for PTEN mutational status, revealing 12 tumors with non-identical PTEN gene mutations. No mutations found in PTEN were effective in predicting tumor response to everolimus treatment. The clinical trial associated with this study is NCT00870337.	23238879	Trédan et al., 2013, Target Oncol	3	accepted	1232	510	41														Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/41/summary/variants/510/summary/evidence/1232/summary#evidence	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/41/summary/variants/510/summary#variant	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu#/events/genes/41/summary#gene
GNAQ	2776	EXON 5 MUTATION	Uveal Melanoma	6039	BAY 86-9766	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Phase 1 study of MAPK1/2 inhibitor BAY 86-9766. 53 patients were evaluated for efficacy, one patients achieved a PR and 11 patients had stable disease. One ocular melanoma patient with prolonged stable disease, who later went on to complete 28 courses, was positive for GNAQ Q209L and PTEN R173S mutations. The PTEN mutation was identified only in the postdose biopsy and not in the predose biopsy.	23434733	Weekes et al., 2013, Clin.

DNMT3A	1788	MUTATION	Myelodysplastic Syndrome	0050908		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	12/150 patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndrome screened for DNMT3A mutations (bone marrow and paired normal skin) had heterozygous mutations with predicted translational consequences. 1 patient was identified with 2 nonsynonymous coding mutations. R882 mutations accounted for 4/13 reported mutations, P904L for 2/13 mutations and the remaining had not been previously reported at the time of this report. Overall and event-free survival were worse for DNMT3A mutant patients although transplantation status was not considered (log-rank p=0.005 and p=0.009). Transformation to AML was increased for mutant 7/12 (58%) versus wildtype 39/138 (28%) patients (p=0.007). The authors note larger cohorts will be required to confirm these results.	21415852	Walter et al., 2011, Leukemia	3	accepted	1238	189	18	2	25455845	25565459			ENST00000264709.3					75	GRCh37	DNMT3A mutations can lead to epigenetic modifications and can cause excessive hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes resulting in increased tumor growth. Methyltransferase inhibitors including decitabine and azacitidine inhibit the activity of DNMT3A and will decrease DNA methylation and potentially restore regular transcriptional activity of tumor suppressor genes.

ROS1	6098	CD74-ROS1 L2155S	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	TAE684,Crizotinib,Foretinib	Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	The L2155S mutation in ROS1 was identified in the HCC78CR1 and HCC78CR2 cell lines. Crystal structure predicted ROS1 L2155S mutation to be highly destabilizating and cause protein structural modification. HCC78CR1, 2, and 3 cells and Ba/F3 cells transfected with this mutation, showed resistance to crizotinib compared with parental HCC78 cells. In addition, these cell lines showed resistance to foretinib, a potent ROS1 inhibitor that is effective against ROS1 G2032R-mutant cells (16), and TAE684, a potent ALK inhibitor	25688157	Song et al., 2015, Clin.
