<li><strong>Public Release 2.0 of AACR Project GENIE</strong>:</li>
<ul>  
<li>The first set of cancer genomic data aggregated through AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) was released to the global community in January 2017. The second dataset was released in November 2017, adding more than 13,000 records to the database.  The combined data set now includes over 32,000 de-identified genomic records collected from patients who were treated at each of the consortiumâ€™s participating institutions, making it among the largest fully public cancer genomic data sets released to date. These data will be continuously updated on a quarterly basis.</li>
<li>The combined data set now includes data for 59 major cancer types, including data on nearly 5,000 patients with lung cancer, nearly 4,000 patients with breast cancer, and more than 3,500 patients with colorectal cancer. For more details about the data, and how to use it, consult the <a href="http://www.aacr.org/Research/Research/Documents/GENIE Data Guide.pdf">data guide</a>.</li>
<li>In addition to accessing the data on the AACR Project GENIE cBioPortal website, users can download the data directly from <a href="http://synapse.org/genie">Sage Bionetworks</a>.
