        When the screenshot test fails, it means that the screenshot taken from
        your instance of the portal differs from the screenshot stored in the
        repo.<br />
        <br />
        1. If the change in the screenshot is <b>undesired</b>, i.e. there is
        regression, you should fix your PR.<br />
        <br />
        2. If the change in the screenshot is <b>desired</b>, add the screenshot
        to the repo, commit it and push it to your PR's branch, that is:
        <br />
        <br /> curl > <span class="screenshot-name"></span><br />
        git add <span class="screenshot-name"></span><br />
        <br />
        Then preferably use git commit --amend and change your commit message
        to explain how the commit changed the screenshot. Subsequently force
        push to your <b>own branch</b>.
