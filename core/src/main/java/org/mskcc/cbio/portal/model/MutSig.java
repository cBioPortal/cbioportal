/**

 * We use MutSig as an object to simplify the process of adding and getting
 * data from the mut_sig database in CGDS.
 * The MutSig object takes a total of 13 parameters, 12 of which correspond
 * directly to MutSig data columns, and one of which is a CanonicalGene Object,
 * containing a HugeGeneSymbol and EntrezGeneID.
 * This simplifies the process of switching back between the two, and ensuring
 * a stable system in which gene IDs do not fluctuate.
