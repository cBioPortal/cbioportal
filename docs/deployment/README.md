# Deployment

Private instances of cBioPortal are maintained by institutions and companies [around the world](https://www.cbioportal.org/installations).

An instance can be deployed using Docker **(recommended)** or by building and deploying from source. The source code of cBioPortal is [available](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal) on GitHub under the terms of [Affero GPL V3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

This section contains instructions for both of these paths.

Please note that installing a local version requires system administration skills; for example, installing and configuring Tomcat and MySQL. With limited resources, we cannot provide technical support on system administration.
