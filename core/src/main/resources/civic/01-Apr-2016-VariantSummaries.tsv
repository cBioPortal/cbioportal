1	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/4/summary/variants/1/summary#variant	ABL1	25	BCR-ABL	The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome, is one of the most studied fusion genes in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and ponatinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response.		22	23522397	23632600			ENST00000305877.8	75	GRCh37	9	133729451	133763063	ENST00000318560.5

It has been convincingly shown to be an activating mutation resulting in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity. It has been suggested that this mutation decreases the cell's sensitivity to AKT1 allosteric kinase inhibitors. This, and other AKT1 mutations, are the subject of much research and development for therapeutics.		14	105246551	105246551	C	T	ENST00000407796.2	75	GRCh37

It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations.

The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. Treating cyclin D3 knockout mice with the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of a Notch-driven model of T-ALL.		6	41902671	41909586			ENST00000372991.4	75	GRCh37

High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, are correlated with later stage disease and have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.		19	30302805	30315215			ENST00000262643.3	75	GRCh37

One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter region. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.		9	21974827	21994591			ENST00000498124.1	75	GRCh37

Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.		7	55259514	55259515	CT	AG	ENST00000275493.2	75	GRCh37

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. The third generation TKI's are being developed with this resistance problem in mind, and early stage experiments have shown some efficacy of these drugs in previously resistant tumors with mutant EGFR.

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.		13	28608219	28608351			ENST00000241453.7	75	GRCh37

One study reports FGFR1 aberrations in 3.5% of 4,853 patients of which most are FGFR1 amplifications (Helsten et. al.). Preclinically, FGFR1 amplifications have also been shown to confer sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors (Weiss et. al.). Clinical studies are currently ongoing (e.g. NCT01004224).

Another study reports FGFR1 expression in 35% of primary HNSSC (353 patients) (Göke et. al.). In both studies, FGFR1 gene amplification and expression do not correlate well with about 35% of samples with FGFR1 amplification overexpressing FGFR1 (Göke et. al.). FGFR1 expression also correlated with sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors in preclinical models of lung cancer (Wynes et. al.), HNSSC (Göke et. al.) and urothelial carcinoma (Lamont et. al.).

269	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/4941/summary/variants/269/summary#variant	ROS1	6098	REARRANGEMENT	ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that frequently forms gene fusions in several cancer types. Approximately 2% of NSCLC patients harbor a ROS1 gene fusion. Several fusion partners have been described with a constant ROS1-breakpoint, maintaining the kinase domain (Solomon B, J Clin Oncol. 2015 Mar 20;33(9):972-4. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2014.59.8334.). Following case-studies and retrospective analyses, an expansion cohort of a phase-1 study showed clinical benefit of crizotinib in ROS1 rearranged NSCLC. The benefit was independent of the type of ROS1-rearrangement (Shaw et. al., N Engl J Med. 2014 Nov 20;371(21):1963-71. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1406766).		6	117609463	117747018			ENST00000368508.3	75	GRCh37

272	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/14/summary/variants/272/summary#variant	CDKN2A	1029	EXPRESSION	CDKN2A expression is a surrogate marker of HPV infection in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. CDKN2A (p16) and p53 are inactivated through HPV proteins E6 and E7 and therefore not altered on expression level in HPV-associated carcinomas. However, there is no perfect overlap between p16 expression and HPV status with some 10-12.5% of HPV-negative tumors expressing p16. (Seiwert, T JCO December 10, 2014 vol. 32 no. 35 3914-3916, doi: 10.1200/JCO.2014.57.9268). p16 positivity is a well-established positive prognostic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the primary and, as increasing evidence suggests, recurrent/metastatic disease settings. Predictive information from HPV status have not been established to date. A lack of benefit from EGFR-inhibitors has been proposed by some studies. Other studies were not able to reproduce this finding.		9	21968055	21974865			ENST00000498124.1	75	GRCh37

306	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/20/summary/variants/306/summary#variant	ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.		17	37856333	37884915			ENST00000269571.5	75	GRCh37

In high-grade gliomas, EGFRvIII has been reported in about 30% of cases with EGFR amplification. The EGFRvIII mutation leads to deletion of the receptor ectodomain exons 2-7. The presence of this variant has been linked with clinical response to EGFR TKI.

414	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/events/genes/20/summary/variants/414/summary#variant	ERBB2	2064	M774INSAYVM	Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain occur at a 2-4% frequency in lung adenocarcinomas, the majority of which are in exon 20 as in-frame duplications or insertions in a small 8 codon region (774-781 or 775-782). These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.		17	37880993	37880994		GCTTACGTGATG	ENST00000269571.5	75	GRCh37

In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.		2	209113112	209113112	C	T	ENST00000415913.1	75	GRCh37
