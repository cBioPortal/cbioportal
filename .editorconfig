# The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles
# and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format
# and adhere to defined styles.

# EditorConfig files are read top to bottom and the closest EditorConfig files are read last.
# Properties from matching EditorConfig sections are applied in the order they were read,
# so properties in closer files take precedence.

# Please only specify the formats you want to apply through out the project in this file.
# Otherwise, please create new config file in your directory where you want to apply these styles.

# More details about EditorConfig: http://EditorConfig.org
