# Deploy without Docker

We strongly encourage to use Docker due to the complex architecture of the app, but if that's not possible you can build the various aspects of the application yourself:

  1. [Software Requirements](Software-Requirements.md)
  2. [Pre-Build Steps](Pre-Build-Steps.md)
  3. [Building from Source](Build-from-Source.md)
  4. [Importing the Seed Database](Import-the-Seed-Database.md)
  5. [Deploying the Web Application](Deploying.md)
  6. [Loading a Sample Study](Load-Sample-Cancer-Study.md)
