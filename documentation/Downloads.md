### User Downloads

There are several ways in which one can download data from cBioPortal including manual and programmatic approaches. See options outlined below.

#### Datasets Page

A zip file for each study on [cbioportal.org](https://www.cbioportal.org) can be download from the [Datasets Page](https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets). One can also use the R client [cBioPortalData](/API-and-API-Clients.md#r-client) to programmatically download all of these files.

#### Datahub

The files for each study are also available from our [datahub repository](https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub). This is basically the extracted version of the zip files in the [Datasets Page](https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets). Note that this is a git LFS repo so if you are familiar with git you might prefer using this option.

#### API and API Clients

Besides downloading all the study data one can also request slices of the data using the API. A slice of the data could e.g. be "give me all the mutation data for one patient" or "get me all EGFR mutations for a particular group of samples". There are API clients available in a variety of languages including bash, R and Python. See for more information the [API documentation](/API-and-API-Clients.md#api-and-api-clients).
